# Rocket Gauntlet

Browser-based, Rocket League-style arcade football, built around a gauntlet run:
a sequence of escalating rounds you have to clear back to back.

TypeScript + Vite + Three.js, physics by Rapier.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5173.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `W` / `S` | Throttle / reverse-brake. In the air: pitch down / up |
| `A` / `D` | Steer. In the air: yaw |
| `Space` | Jump. Hold for height; tap again in the air to flip or double jump |
| `Shift` | Boost |
| `Q` / `E` | Air roll left / right |
| `C` | Powerslide |
| `T` | Ball cam |
| `R` | Reset car and ball |
| `B` | Reset ball only |
| `P` | Tuning panel |

## Tuning

Every constant that affects feel lives in [`src/config.ts`](src/config.ts).

**Units are Unreal Units, as Rocket League itself uses: 1 uu = 1 cm.** The pitch
is 10240 x 8192 x 2044, the ball is 91.25 across the radius, and the car hitbox
is 120.5 x 86.7 x 38.7. Working at this scale means the published Rocket League
handling figures drop straight in rather than being re-derived at some other
scale, which is what makes the car feel like a car.

The figures the handling is built on:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Gravity | 650 (not Earth's 981 — this is what makes aerials floaty and committed) |
| Throttle acceleration | 1600 at rest, 160 at 1400, nothing at 1410 |
| Throttle top speed | 1410 |
| Boost acceleration | 991.67, burning 33.3 boost/second |
| Hard speed cap | 2300; supersonic from 2200 |
| Braking | 3500. Coasting | 525 |
| Jump | 291.67 impulse, then 1458.33 held for 0.2s |
| Dodge | 500 in the dodge direction |
| Air control | pitch 12.46, yaw 9.11, roll 38.34 rad/s^2, capped at 5.5 rad/s |
| Ball | radius 91.25, mass 30, restitution 0.6, 3% drag/s, capped at 6000 |

Two interchangeable ways to change any of it, both live:

- Press `P` for the in-game panel. Sliders write straight into the live config.
  `Copy values` puts the current numbers on your clipboard in `config.ts` shape.
- Edit `src/config.ts` and save. Vite patches the values in place; no reload, and
  the car keeps its position and momentum.

The throttle and steering curves are lookup tables rather than single numbers,
so they live in the file rather than on a slider.

## Layout

```
src/
  config.ts            all tuning constants, live-reloadable
  game.ts              wires the systems together
  core/      loop, interpolation, arena geometry, math helpers
  physics/   rapier world, arena colliders, car, ball, boost pads
  input/     CarInput contract, keyboard source
  render/    three scene, meshes, chase camera
  ui/        HUD, tuning panel
tests/       headless physics checks (vitest)
```

The arena's colliders and its meshes are both generated from
`core/arenaLayout.ts`, so they cannot drift apart.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

58 tests, no browser needed. The ones that matter check the handling against the
figures above rather than just checking it does not crash: that throttle tops out
at 1410 and boost carries you to 2300, that acceleration collapses near the top
end, that braking stops the car inside half a second, that turn radius widens
with speed, that jump heights match their closed-form values, that a dodge adds
its own 500, that roll is far faster than pitch or yaw, and that a fast car
transitions onto the side wall and climbs it with its wheels down.

## Debugging

`window.game` is exposed in the console.

- `game.advance(seconds, input?)` steps the simulation a fixed amount and draws
  one frame, without waiting on the render loop. Useful for stepping through a
  specific situation. `input` takes any subset of `CarInput`, e.g.
  `game.advance(1, { throttle: 1, boost: true })`.
- `game.debug` exposes `car`, `ball`, `arena`, `pads` and `phys`.
