# Rocket Gauntlet

Browser-based, Rocket League-style arcade football, built around a gauntlet run:
a sequence of escalating rounds you have to clear back to back.

TypeScript + Vite + Three.js, physics by Rapier.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5173.

## Where this is up to

Build order from the brief, and what exists:

| Step | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Arena, car, ball, camera | Done |
| 2. Goals, scoring, match flow | Done |
| 3. One AI bot | Next |
| 4. Gauntlet structure and round escalation | Not started |
| 5. Upgrades between rounds | Not started |
| 6. Boss rounds | Not started |
| 7. Menus, run summary, polish | Not started |

There is no opponent yet, so a match is you against an empty net: you can score,
and you can score on yourself. The flow around it is complete — countdown,
clock, goals, kickoffs, win conditions, sudden death.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `W` / `S` | Throttle / reverse-brake. In the air: pitch down / up |
| `A` / `D` | Steer. In the air: yaw |
| `Space` | Jump. Hold for height; tap again in the air to flip or double jump |
| `Shift` | Boost |
| `Q` / `E` | Air roll left / right |
| `C` | Powerslide |
| `T` | Ball cam |
| `R` | Restart the match |
| `B` | Reset the ball only |
| `P` | Tuning panel |

## Tuning

Every constant that affects feel lives in [`src/config.ts`](src/config.ts).

**Units are Unreal Units, as Rocket League itself uses: 1 uu = 1 cm.** The pitch
is 10240 x 8192 x 2044, the ball is 91.25 across the radius, and the car hitbox
is 120.5 x 86.7 x 38.7. Working at this scale means the published Rocket League
handling figures drop straight in rather than being re-derived at some other
scale, which is what makes the car feel like a car.

The figures the handling is built on:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Gravity | 650 (not Earth's 981 — this is what makes aerials floaty and committed) |
| Throttle acceleration | 1600 at rest, 160 at 1400, nothing at 1410 |
| Throttle top speed | 1410 |
| Boost acceleration | 991.67, burning 33.3 boost/second |
| Hard speed cap | 2300; supersonic from 2200 |
| Braking | 3500. Coasting | 525 |
| Jump | 291.67 impulse, then 1458.33 held for 0.2s |
| Dodge | 500 in the dodge direction |
| Air control | pitch 12.46, yaw 9.11, roll 38.34 rad/s^2, capped at 5.5 rad/s |
| Ball | radius 91.25, mass 30, restitution 0.6, 3% drag/s, capped at 6000 |

Two interchangeable ways to change any of it, both live:

- Press `P` for the in-game panel. Sliders write straight into the live config.
  `Copy values` puts the current numbers on your clipboard in `config.ts` shape.
- Edit `src/config.ts` and save. Vite patches the values in place; no reload, and
  the car keeps its position and momentum.

The throttle and steering curves are lookup tables rather than single numbers,
so they live in the file rather than on a slider.

## Match rules

Set in the `match` block of [`src/config.ts`](src/config.ts): 90 seconds, first
to 3, a 3 second countdown, 2.5 seconds of goal celebration, sudden death on a
draw. The gauntlet will drive these per round rather than reading the defaults.

A goal needs the ball *fully* past the line, as in the real game: its centre a
full radius beyond `goalLine`, inside the mouth and under the bar. The clock
holds during the celebration and the countdown, so only playing time counts.
Own goals are attributed from the last touch and credited to the other side.

[`src/state/match.ts`](src/state/match.ts) owns no entities — it is told where
the ball is and reports what happened, and the caller does the resetting. That
is what makes it testable without a physics world, and it is why the gauntlet
can drive it with whatever rules a round needs.

## Layout

```
src/
  config.ts            all tuning constants, live-reloadable
  game.ts              wires the systems together
  core/      loop, interpolation, arena geometry, curves, math helpers
  physics/   rapier world, arena colliders, car, ball, boost pads
  input/     CarInput contract, keyboard source
  state/     match flow: clock, score, goals, win conditions
  render/    three scene, meshes, chase camera
  ui/        car HUD, scoreboard and banners, tuning panel
tests/       headless physics checks (vitest)
```

The arena's colliders and its meshes are both generated from
`core/arenaLayout.ts`, so they cannot drift apart.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

82 tests, no browser needed.

The handling tests check against the published figures rather than just checking
it does not crash: that throttle tops out at 1410 and boost carries you to 2300,
that acceleration collapses near the top end, that braking stops the car inside
half a second, that turn radius widens with speed, that jump heights match their
closed-form values, that a dodge adds its own 500, that roll is far faster than
pitch or yaw, and that a fast car transitions onto the side wall and climbs it
with its wheels down.

The match tests run the rules with no physics at all — a ball position and a
clock is all the state machine needs: full crossing of the line, balls wide of
the mouth and over the bar, own goal attribution, one goal rather than one per
step in the net, the kickoff cycle, the goal target, time expiry, sudden death,
and that nothing scores before kickoff or after full time.

## Debugging

`window.game` is exposed in the console.

- `game.advance(seconds, input?)` steps the simulation a fixed amount and draws
  one frame, without waiting on the render loop. Useful for stepping through a
  specific situation. `input` takes any subset of `CarInput`, e.g.
  `game.advance(1, { throttle: 1, boost: true })`.
- `game.debug` exposes `car`, `ball`, `arena`, `pads` and `phys`.
